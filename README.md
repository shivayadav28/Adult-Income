# Adult-Income
The dataset provided, often referred to as the Adult Income Dataset, is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is based on the 1994 Census database. Hereâ€™s a summary of its main details:

## Dataset Overview
## Objective: Predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on various personal attributes.
## Number of Instances: 48,842 entries (32,561 for training and 16,281 for testing).
## Attributes: 15 attributes including both continuous and categorical variables.
## Class Distribution:
'>50K' : 23.93% of instances
'<=50K' : 76.07% of instances
## Attribute Information
## age: Continuous
## workclass: Categorical (e.g., Private, Self-employed, Government)
## fnlwgt: Continuous
## education: Categorical (e.g., Bachelors, High School)
## education-num: Continuous
## marital-status: Categorical (e.g., Married, Never-married)

## relationship: Categorical (e.g., Husband, Wife, Own-child)
## race: Categorical (e.g., White, Black, Asian-Pac-Islander)
## sex: Categorical (Male, Female)
## capital-gain: Continuous
## capital-loss: Continuous
## hours-per-week: Continuous
## native-country: Categorical (e.g., United-States, Canada, Mexico)
## income: Binary class label (<=50K or >50K)
## Missing Values
Approximately 7% of records contain missing values, specifically in the "workclass," "occupation," and "native-country" attributes.

This dataset is commonly used for classification tasks to evaluate model performance across various algorithms due to its challenging nature
